### main 
请你找到高难度SQL试卷得分平均值大于80并且是7级的红名大佬，统计他们的2021年试卷总完成次数和题目总练习次数，只保留2021年有试卷完成记录的用户。结果按试卷完成数升序，按题目练习数降序。
```sql
-- 主要信息
difficulty='hard'
tag='sql'
avg(er.score)>80
ui.level=7
where year(submit_time)=2021
count(exam_id) as exam_cnt
count(question_id) as question_cnt
```
### CODE
```sql
select 
    uid,
    exam_cnt,
    IFNULL(question_cnt,0) as question_cnt
from
    (
        select uid
        from exam_record
        join user_info using(uid)
        join examination_info using(exam_id)
        where level=7 and tag='SQL' and difficulty='hard'
        group by uid
        having avg(score)>80
    ) as t_uid

    (
        select 
            uid,
            count(exam_id) as exam_cnt
        from user_info
        join exam_record using (uid)
